 * 
 * For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's
 * size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is
 * to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
 * following requirements:
 * 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
 * target area.
 * 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as
 * possible.
 * 
 * You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed
 * in sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: 4
 * Output: [2, 2]
 * Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it
 * are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
 * But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement
 * 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the
 * width W is 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
 * The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
